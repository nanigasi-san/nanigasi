[Living Organisms and Environment]
There are various environments on Earth.
Example: very cold areas, areas where it rains very little, tropical areas where weather is hot sand humid with lot of rains.
All living organisms(plant, animal) live in each environment is called a biome.

{Land Biomes}
Planta are the center of a biome.
Based on various features of plants, land biomes can be divided into roughly 10 types.

{Tropical Rain Forests}
This biome exits in hot and humid weather in the tropical regions.
Many types of trees create jungles.50~80% of all species on Earth live in this biome.

{Savannas}
A biome which is distributed in tropical and subtropical regions, where temperature is high.
Tall trees are scattered in the meadows. Lion, giraffes, reptiles and others live there.

{Mediterranean Regions}
This biome is distributed in the temperate zone in areas where winter is mid(cool) with lot of rains and summer is hot and dry.
Trees have hard leaves that do not evaporate moisture. They adapted to dry weather.
(Examples: olives and eucalyptus). Rabbits inhabit in these regions.

{Temperate Forests}
This biome is distributed in the temperate zone.
In the Temperate Zone:
    Broad-leaves evergreen trees(such as camphor etc.)are found in the warm areas.
    Deciduous hardwood trees(such as oak, etc.)that loose leaves in the winter are found in the cold areas.
Many kinds of plants and animals are found.

{Cool Forests}
This biome is distributed in the subarctic zone.
here is only a few types of trees. Most of them are coniferous trees.
Small animals(squirrels, rabbits, etc.)and large animals(Mousee, bears, etc.)that adapted to cold weather inhabit in the subarctic zone.
